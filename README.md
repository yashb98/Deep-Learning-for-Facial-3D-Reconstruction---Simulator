# Deep-Learning-for-Facial-3D-Reconstruction---Simulator
This project simulates 3D facial reconstruction. It normalizes a 3D model by centering and scaling it, then renders a large set of 2D images from various angles. Finally, it uses a deep learning model (SixDRepNet) to analyze the images, find the most frontal pose, and apply that rotation back to the 3D model.
